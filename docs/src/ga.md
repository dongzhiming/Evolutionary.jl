## Description

The [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)  is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as [Mutation](@ref), [Crossover](@ref) and [Selection](@ref) [^1].
